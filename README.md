# backpropagation
An implementation of the widely used neural network algorithm with added features 
The code is written in C++ after study of the details of the Backpropagation algorithm.
The data is trained on the IRIS dataset.

An additional feature is added which allows the model to update the model after deployment, pointing towards interactive ML.
